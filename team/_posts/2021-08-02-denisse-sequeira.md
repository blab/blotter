I have a Bachelors in Neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh and a Masters in Public Management from Carnegie Mellon University. I recently joined the Bedford Lab as a Program Manager, having previously worked conducting strategy and project management for a large health insurer on projects related to end-of-life care, social determinants of health, and cost improvement initiatives. Prior to that role I was a clinical research coordinator, managing multiple research projects within Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. I was fortunate enough to work on every step in the research process â€“ from consenting participants, performing statistical analysis and grant management. I am excited to return to a non-profit research environment and be a part of impactful, translational work at Fred Hutch.
