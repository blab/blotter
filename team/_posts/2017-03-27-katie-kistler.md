I am a first-year graduate student in the University of Washington's Molecular and Cellular Biology program. As a rotation student in the Bedford lab, I am particularly interested in studying the phylodynamics of pathogens in order to understand and predict transmission and infectivity of human viruses. Prior to joining the PhD program at the University of Washington, I was a technician in the labs of Ruth Lehmann at New York University and Leslie Vosshall at Rockefeller University. In the Vosshall lab, I studied sensory systems of the mosquito that allow this potent disease vector to locate human hosts and reproduce. In a previous rotation with Harmit Malik (also at the Fred Hutchinson), I had the opportunity to investigate mosquito genetics and the host-parasite interaction from a different angle, using evolutionary-guided approaches to identify important genes and biological functions. This research piqued my interest in viral evolution.
