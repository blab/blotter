I started as a postdoc in 2022, after getting my PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology in the Bedford lab. I am broadly interested in studying the process of evolution including how host/pathogen interactions sculpt genomes, how evidence of selective forces like these can be seen in sequence data, and how epistasis constrains evolutionary potential. My work uses phylogenetic and sequence-based approaches to learn about patterns of viral evolution in the viruses that commonly infect us.
