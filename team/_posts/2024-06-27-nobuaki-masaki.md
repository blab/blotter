I am a fourth year Biostatistics Ph.D. student in the Bedford lab. I graduated with a BA in statistics from Carleton College in 2020. My research interests are in statistical genetics.
Iâ€™m currently working on developing a hidden Markov model to identify recombinant SARS-CoV-2 sequences and their parental lineages.
