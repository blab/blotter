I joined the Bedford Lab near the end of April, 2024. I have a PhD in
Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology from the University of Arizona,
followed by over 20 years of software development experience in a
variety of spheres, from Federal government contracting to
general-purpose tech consulting to greenfield software development for
biotech startups. I am looking forward to leveraging my unusual
combination of biology knowledge and software development experience
to helping [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) continue to improve in
large and small ways.
