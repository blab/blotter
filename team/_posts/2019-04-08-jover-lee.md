I am a new bioinformatics analyst at the Bedford lab. I received my Bachelor's degree in Molecular Toxicology from the College of Natural Resources at UC Berkeley. I graduated from the inaugural class of the full-stack coding bootcamp at the University of Washington. I am excited to be in a position where I can combine my love for biological research and my new found love of coding.
