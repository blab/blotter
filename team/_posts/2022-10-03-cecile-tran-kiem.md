I joined the lab as a postdoc in October 2022. I am interested in developing modelling approaches to better understand the propagation of pathogens in populations by combining more traditional epidemiological data with viral sequence information.

I obtained my PhD in the [Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases unit at Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/team/mathematical-modelling-of-infectious-diseases/) (Paris France), under the supervision of Simon Cauchemez. During these three years, I developed mathematical and statistical models to characterize the spread and control of SARS-CoV-2 in France.
At the end of the first wave, we were able to estimate [the burden of the epidemic in France](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc3517).
Later on, I developed a modelling framework to [estimate the contribution of different age groups to transmission](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27163-1), from which I was able to derive the impact of age-targeted control measures. We also [characterized the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in a partially vaccinated population](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02235-1).
Finally, I conducted a range of analyses assessing the impact of interventions, such as [lockdowns](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.22.2001536), [curfews](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21944-4) or vaccination (*e.g.* [vaccine prioritization strategies](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00281-9), [risks and benefits associated with the distribution of Vaxzevria](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.26.2100533) or [booster distribution strategies](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.1.2101125)).
The results of theses analyses were shared with French decision makers and public health agencies along the course of the pandemic.

I also hold an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique (France) and an MSc in Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning from Imperial College London (UK).
