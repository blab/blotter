I am a 2nd-year student in the University of Washington’s Medical Scientist Training Program rotating in the Bedford lab this summer. I'm working on geographic, phylogenetic analysis of flu transmission in Seattle. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry from Montana State University where I discovered characterized a novel viral family from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park with Mark Young. I then worked with a small NGO in Kamuli, Uganda launching a pediatric medical clinic.
