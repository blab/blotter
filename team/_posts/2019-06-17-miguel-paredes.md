I am a second year in the University of Washington’s MD-PhD Program rotating in the Bedford Lab. My work in the lab focuses mainly on understanding flu transmission in Seattle through the use of phylogenetic analyses. I received my Bachelors of Science in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from Yale University and a Masters in Public Health with a focus on the epidemiology of neglected tropical diseases from the Yale School of Public Health.
