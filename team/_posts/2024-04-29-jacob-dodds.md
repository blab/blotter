Hello! I am an Administrative Coordinator in the Bedford Lab. I am responsible for managing various operational and administrative tasks that help keep the lab operating smoothly. I aim to be a resource for those working within and alongside the lab.

Prior to joining Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Bedford Lab, I worked in philanthropic project management and disability inclusion. These roles include working as an Individual Giving Coordinator at the Oregon Food Bank (OFC) and as an Accessibility Partner at Amazon.
