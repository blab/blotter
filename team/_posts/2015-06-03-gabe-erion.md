I am a first-year MD-PhD student at the University of Washington. My research interests focus on building algorithmic and statistical tools to learn about and combat disease.

I graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor's degree in Applied Math in 2015. My research at the Harvard School of Public Health developed methods for learning about HIV dynamics from genetic sequence data, even when these data are incomplete.

I did a rotation with Trevor Bedford in summer 2015 on influenza migration patterns and am now working to finish up this rotation project.
