I joined the lab in October of 2019 as a Postdoc to work on several aspects of the evolution and transmission of infectious diseases.
Currently I am involved in studying the local spread of influenza as part of the Seattle Flu Study.
Additionally, I am studying how reassortment influences the fitness of seasonal human influenza viruses, based on [reassortment networks](https://doi.org/10.1101/726042) reconstructed from genetic sequences data of different segments from seasonal human influenza viruses.

Before joining the lab, I was doing a PhD with [Prof. Tanja Stadler at ETH Zürich in Switzerland](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo) from April 2016 to September 2019.
During that time, I was working on theoretical aspects of models that allow us to efficiently infer [how lineages coalesce within and migrate between different sub-populations](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/34/11/2970/3896419).
Additionally, I was developing tools that allow to [connect rates of coalescence and migration to be connected to predictor data](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article-abstract/5/2/vez030/5549805), or to [infer the shared history of species in the presence of gene flow](https://doi.org/10.1101/348391).
Later during my PhD, I was developing a [Markov chain Monte Carlo framework to infer reassortment networks from genetic sequence data of segmented viruses](https://doi.org/10.1101/726042).
Additionally, I was working on studying the local spread of Influenza as part of the [Influenza in Basel Study](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo/research/influenza-in-basel.html).

A lot of my research that includes developing novel methods end up as [BEAST2](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006650) packages. These include  [CoalRe](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726042v1.abstract), [CoupledMCMC](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/603514v1.abstract), [MASCOT](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/34/22/3843/5001387), and [AIM in StarBeast2](Inference of species histories in the presence of gene flow). Additionally, I was involved in organizing and teaching at several [Taming the Beast workshops](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/67/1/170/3897660).
