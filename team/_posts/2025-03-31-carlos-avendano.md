I am a first year MCB student at the University of Washington. I finished my undergrad at Oregon State University where I studied Marine biology. After graduating, I worked in the Greninger lab at UW as a research scientist studying rhinovirus and _Treponema pallidum_. My research interests are in computational biology, virology and genomics.
