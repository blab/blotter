I am a first year Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) PhD student rotating in the Bedford Lab. My research interests are understanding viral evolution, viral immune escape and spillover events.

I received my undergrad degree at UC Davis where I researched viral hijacking of innate immunity for replication. Afterwards, I completed my masters at San Francisco State University investigating the role of microRNAs for cell fate selection using scRNAseq.
