Charlton joined the lab in summer of 2015 as [SURP Undergraduate Intern](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/education-training/undergraduate-students.html) coming from the UW Microbiology department. That summer Charlton worked a project looking at the degree to which protein stability affects influenza evolution. Code from this work can be found [here](https://github.com/blab/stability). In 2016, Charlton built a [custom Rethink database](/projects/nextstrain-db/) to manage viral sequence data and serological data for the lab. This database is now a key component of the nextstrain pipeline.

Charlton graduated from UW with a joint degree in Microbiology and Applied and Computational Math Sciences. He has now moved on to a [Post-Bachelor Fellowship at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](http://www.healthdata.org/post-bachelor-fellowship) at the UW.
