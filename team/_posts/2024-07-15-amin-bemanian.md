I am a pediatric infectious disease fellow at the University of Washington/Seattle Children's Hospital who joined the lab in July 2024. My research focuses on investigating geospatial patterns of spread and transmission in viruses by utilizing phylogenetic and sequencing data.

I completed my graduate and medical training at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, WI, where I received my PhD in Public and Community Health. For my dissertation work, I worked on mapping [liver cancer mortality in Wisconsin](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-019-01232-9) and investigated the role of [racial residential segregation in cancer disparities](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/26/4/516/175727/Measures-Matter-The-Local-Exposure-Isolation-LEx). Afterwards, I completed my pediatric residency at the University of Washington/Seattle Children's Hospital. During my residency training, I worked at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation where I completed a research project looking at the spatial accessibility of the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in King County.
