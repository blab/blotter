I am an Administrative Coordinator in the Bedford Lab. I manage a variety of operational needs to help keep the lab running smoothly. I enjoy being a resource the lab can turn to for support.

Prior to joining Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Bedford Lab, I was a Research Administrator in the Basic Sciences Division of Fred Hutch.
