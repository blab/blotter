As a staff scientist in the Bedford Lab, my work includes independent research, software development, and educational outreach and mentorship.
I study the evolution of seasonal influenza viruses, develop computational models to predict the composition of future influenza populations, and contribute to reports to the World Health Organization's vaccine composition meetings.
I am also a core developer of Nextstrain's real-time pathogen surveillance tools including [the Augur bioinformatics toolkit](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur) and [the SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology workflow](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/).
This work builds on my previous professional roles as a bioinformatics specialist and software developer and my previous educational experiences including masterâ€™s degrees in computer science and biology.
