I am a PhD student in the Bedford lab through the University of Washington’s Medical Scientist Training Program. My research broadly focuses on applying phylodynamic methods to study tumor evolution and spatial growth dynamics. Specifically, I am working to elucidate spatial and genetic factors that influence cellular fitness in prostate cancer. In addition, I adapt phylodynamic models developed in other fields to [reconstruct cancer growth from multi-region sequencing data](https://github.com/blab/hcc-tumor-evol) and [infer spatial constraints on tumor growth](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/2080/submission/563).

Prior to joining the Bedford group, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Bachelor’s degree in biology and completed a thesis [characterizing inherited hematologic malignancies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26712909/) under Dr\. Lucy Godley. My current work builds on this experience in cancer genetics and seeks to integrate evolutionary and genetic approaches into understanding clinical tumor progression.
