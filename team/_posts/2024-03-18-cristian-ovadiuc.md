I am a first-year PhD student in Public Health Genetics formally trained as an epidemiologist, having completed a [MS in Genetic Epidemiology](https://iphg.biostat.washington.edu/programs/ms) at the University of Washington. Additionally, I have worked at the [California Department of Public Health's Division of Communicable Disease Control](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/DCDC.aspx) and completed a year-long applied/field epidemiology training program - [UW Student Epidemic Actions Leaders Team](https://epi.washington.edu/students/student-epidemic-action-leaders-seal-team/) ran by Dr. Janet Baseman.  Most recently, I have also contributed to research aimed at identifying population outliers with rare human genetic mutations that exhibit resistance to infectious diseases at the UW Center for Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases (CERID) with [Dr. Thomas Hawn](https://cerid.uw.edu/people/thomas-hawn).
