I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Public Health Genetics ([data science/ml track](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-learning/data-science-at-uw/grad-students/grad-options/)) at the University of Washington in the [McCrone](https://mccronelab.github.io/) and [Bedford](https://bedford.io/) labs under the joint mentorship of [Dr. JT McCrone](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/mccrone-john.html) and [Dr. Trevor Bedford](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/bedford-trevor.html).

For my research, I am starting with focusing on viral dynamics across biological scales from molecular to global phylodynamics linking within-host viral evolution to between-host viral dynamics. Also interested in AI-driven predictive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict viral-host compatibility and enhance [Nextstrain's](https://nextstrain.org/) real-time tracking of pathogen evolution.

Prior, I formally trained as an epidemiologist, holding a [MS in Genetic Epidemiology](https://iphg.biostat.washington.edu/programs/ms) and worked at the [California Department of Public Health's Division of Communicable Disease Control](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/DCDC.aspx) in addition to completing a year-long field/applied epidemiology training program â€“ [UW Student Epidemic Action Leaders (SEAL) Team](https://epi.washington.edu/students/student-epidemic-action-leaders-seal-team/)  lead by Dr. Janet Baseman through the UW Dept. of Epidemiology. Some of my research experience includes roles at the [UW Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Disease Research](https://cerid.uw.edu/) in the [Hawn Lab](https://cerid.uw.edu/people/thomas-hawn), the [UW Institute for Protein Design](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/) in the [Baker Lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/), the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/), and [Harvard's Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/).

More broadly, my interdisciplinary background across multiple biological scales converges on high level pandemic preparedness and response as part of [Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security - Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity (ELBI) Class of 2024](https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/education-training/emerging-leaders-in-biosecurity-fellowship). (See [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhcenterforhealthsecurity_activity-7171303534032736256-WXhZ) -- I attended the 1st ELBI meeting in Washington DC w/ the [White House --- Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/oppr/) lead by Major General (ret) Paul Friedrichs).
