I am a rising senior at Smith College, pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in History and Statistical and Data Sciences. I joined the Bedford Lab through Fred Hutch's Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) for the summer of 2025. My work with the lab uses neural networks to predict the geographic origin of genetic samples.
