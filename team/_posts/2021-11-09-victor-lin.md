I am a full stack developer supporting development of [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org). Previously, I was a software engineer on the Microsoft cloud security team building automation tools for security analysts. Other prior involvements include building [serratus.io](https://serratus.io), a virus discovery platform based on public data within the Sequence Read Archive, and supporting cancer research under [Dr. Lei Zhou](http://mgm.ufl.edu/profile/zhou-lei/).

I graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's in computer science and statistics.
