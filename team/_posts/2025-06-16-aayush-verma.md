My name is Aayush Verma (He/Him) and I am a post-bac research assistant working on evolutionary forecasting of viruses and evolution-informed machine learning models. I completed my undergrad from the University of Maryland, graduating with a double major in math and computer science. Previously, I worked on computer vision models with applications to biomedical imaging under Dr. Aaron Lee at the University of Washington Lee Lab. My primary research interest is interpretable generative modeling.
