My name is Philippa Steinberg (They/Them), and I am a first-year Molecular and Cell Biology PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle. I was born and raised in Hamburg, Germany and graduated with a BA in Integrative Biology and a minor in Data Science from UC Berkeley in 2023.

For my rotation in the Bedford lab I am working with John Huddleston on applying MLR models to study fitness variation of seasonal influenza across geographies.
My general research interests are method development for population genetics, theoretical evolution, phylogenomics. Further, I care about addressing social determinants of health and creating accessible science education.
