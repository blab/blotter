I am a bioinformatician at the Bedford lab. I co-majored in Computer Science and Biochemistry from [Cornell College](https://www.cornellcollege.edu/) graduating in 2011 and went on to get a PhD in Bioinformatics from [Iowa State University](https://www.bcb.iastate.edu/) in 2017. My [PhD research software](https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13040-016-0105-5) led to co-founding a small software startup. After which, I joined [Amy Vincent's Lab](https://www.bcb.iastate.edu/people/amy-vincent) as a [USDA ORISE postdoc](https://orise.orau.gov/usda-ars/) and automated the quarterly [Influenza A Virus in Swine (IAV-S) survellence](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/sa_animal_disease_information/sa_swine_health/ct_siv_surveillance/) reports from 2017-2020. From 2020-21, I was an [ORISE-SCINet postdoc](https://scinet.usda.gov/), co-designing virtual events to train USDA researches on how to use the HPC and wrap their pipelines in nextflow.

I am excited to be part of this team and automation is very important to me. I enjoy broad collaborations, interesting problems, and reducing inefficiency.
