I was a [Mahan Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/phs/projects/herbold-computational-biology-program/mahan-postdoctoral-fellowship/past-mahan-fellows.html) with the Bedford lab at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org/) where I worked on or contributed to phylogenetic studies of RNA virus outbreak dynamics:

- [Genome-wide evolutionary dynamics of influenza B viruses on a global scale](http://bedford.io/papers/langat-flu-b-dynamics/) led by Pinky Langat
- [Genomic epidemiology reveals multiple introductions of Zika virus into the United States](http://bedford.io/papers/grubaugh-zika-in-florida/) led by Nathan Grubaugh
- [Virus genomes reveal factors that spread and sustained the Ebola epidemic](http://bedford.io/papers/dudas-ebola-epidemic-spread/) in collaboration with Andrew Rambaut, Philippe Lemey, Luiz Max Carvalho, Andrew Tatem, and Marc Suchard
- [MERS-CoV spillover at the camel-human interface](http://bedford.io/papers/dudas-mers-structure/)


I am now a group leader at Vilnius University's [Life Sciences Center](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/) and you can keep up to date with what I get up to on [my website](https://evogytis.github.io/).
