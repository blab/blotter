I joined the Bedford Lab in mid 2018 as a computing generalist focused on software engineering.
I work on all aspects of [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org), including backend systems, the website frontend, new features for sharing and collaboration, data management, and operational processes.
My focus, as of late 2021, is reducing the barriers to entry to use Nextstrain in public health and research settings.

From late 2018 to mid 2021, I was focused on the [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org), where I started as the sole engineer for the informatics group.
I designed and built the Study's [central informatics system](https://github.com/seattleflu/id3c) and staffed up and lead the software development team to build and maintain the [many software systems](https://github.com/seattleflu) which support the ever-changing work of the Study.
