Cooling on a two-photon transition with an optical frequency comb is published.   In [Wes Campbell's Lab](http://campbellgroup.physics.ucla.edu/) at UCLA we demonstrated that by driving a two-photon transition the entire power of an optical frequency comb can be utilized to laser cool and trap atoms.  We developed the technique (using rubidium) in order to laser cool atoms with deeply bound valence electrons such as hydrogen and carbon for precision measurement and quantum chemistry.
