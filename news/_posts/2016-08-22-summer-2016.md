This has been a busy, but fun and productive, summer. Lots of things going on. I had a couple conferences, traveled to [Brazil in June](/news/zibra-project/) to help with Zika sequencing and traveled to [South Korea for a collaborative visit](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/748188018024972288). In addition to lab things, I've been working with [Charlton Callender](http://chacalle.github.io/), [Richard Neher](https://neherlab.wordpress.com/) and [Colin Megill](https://twitter.com/colinmegill) on the [nextstrain](http://nextstrain.org/) project, trying to get all the pieces of the pipeline together. We're basically doing a full refactor from the existing [nextflu codebase](/projects/nextflu/) to include a [database to manage sequence and serological data](/projects/fauna/), [improved build pipelines](/projects/augur/) and more [flexible visualization tools](/projects/auspice/). I'll try to write more on the nextstrain project at a later date. We're trying to have a prototype ready by Dec 1 when [Open Science Prize](https://www.openscienceprize.org/res/p/finalists/#2) judging will be held.

Lots of activity in the lab:

* [Alvason Li](/team/alvason-li/) designed some really nice analyses to track T cell dynamics using TCR repertoire data in collaborative project with [Jia Zhu](http://research.fhcrc.org/corey/en/leadership/Zhu-J.html). We're writing this up now for publication, but some of the analyses can be seen [here](https://github.com/alvason/cell-repertoire). In July, Alvason departed for a postdoc in the [Corey Lab](http://research.fhcrc.org/corey/en.html) to focus more on TCR repertoire analysis.

* [Gytis Dudas](/team/gytis-dudas/) is finishing up a *massive* phylogeographic analysis of Ebola spread in West Africa. A few public results are [here](https://github.com/ebov/space-time).

* [Allison Black](/team/allison-black/) passed her Epi quals (yay!) and is now thinking towards dissertation projects. We're trying to get some in-house sequencing capabilities set up. Super exciting.

* [Sidney Bell](/team/sidney-bell/) is finishing up a project on lentiviruses and cross-species transmission. Working on lentiviruses phylogenetics proved rather difficult (deep phylogenies with lots of recombination), but Sidney did splendidly. Sidney will be pursuing a PhD in the lab, jointly advised by Michael Emerman.

* [Charlton Callender](/team/charlton-callender/) did an amazing job in building the database [fauna](/projects/fauna/), which is now capable of handling sequence and serological data for flu, Zika and Ebola. This deserves a news post of its own at some point. In September, Charlton will be starting a [Post-Bachelor Fellowship at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](http://www.healthdata.org/post-bachelor-fellowship) at the UW. Sad to losing him, but excited to see what he'll accomplish at IHME.

* [Stephanie Stacy](/team/stephanie-stacy/) spent the summer with the lab at part of the [Undergraduate Internship Program](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/education-training/undergraduate-students.html). She did a fantastic job developing a [statistical method to estimate missed infections in a phylogenetic tree](/projects/unsampled/). We imagine this could be useful for outbreak response. Steph won the award for [best poster presentation at the SURP Poster Session](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/764293232758960128).

* [Eden Berga](/team/eden-berga/) and [Natalie Boesen](/team/natalie-boesen/) spent the summer with the lab through the [High School Internship Program](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/careers/internship-opportunities/high-school-internship.html). In the internship, Natalie and Eden learned how to program in program in Python and run phylogeographic analyses. They've both done impressive work and their resulting write-ups have been posted to GitHub for [Eden's project on yellow fever](/projects/yellow-fever/) and [Natalie's project on chikungunya](/projects/chikv/).

I'm looking forward to the coming year. We have lots of momentum at this point and it will be fun to see the science that's produced.
