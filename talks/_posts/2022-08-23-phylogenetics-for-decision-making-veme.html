<!-- ~1.5hr lecture total, but aiming for abundant discussion -->

<!-- Perhaps align section on "understanding variants" with upcoming SAVE presentation -->

<!--
Outline:
- general use cases for genomic epi across flu, Zika, Ebola, etc..
- applications to pandemic, but make this a personal journey
  - Wuhan emergence, Nextstrain and R0
    - My interactions, covering mass emails, Gates Foundation, reporters, Twitter
  - cryptic transmission and testing in Seattle
	  - My interactions, covering struggle to test samples, testing anyway, the Twitter announcement,
		  calls with state and local government, the shutdown, Worobey's analysis and our eventual Science paper
	- better delineation of my relationship to public through Twitter, reporters and policy makers
	  - just trying to understand what's going on, and where genomics help, but need to be combined with other sources of knowledge
	- other notable 2020 events: origins and lack of 2019 international spread, WH sequencing, lagged prediction of deaths from cases
	- emergence of initial variants of concern in Dec 2020 / Jan 2021
	  - warning in NYT Opinion that we don't as a world have sufficient genomic surveillance
	  - focus again on understanding what's going on, genomic frequency data critical, but also contact tracing data from the UK
	- shift in focus in 2021 to tracking emerging variants and trying to balance sensitivity and specificity in alerting
	- emergence of Omicron
	  - alerting / understanding, antigenic drift, rate of spread, forecasting when epidemic hits in Seattle
	- after initial Omicron wave, 2022 has been mostly tracking emerging variants and work on monkeypox

	<h3>Takeaways</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Phylogenetics and genomic epidemiology most impactful early on, when case-based
			surveillance is poor</li>
		<li>Phylogenetic analysis should be combined with other sources of knowledge</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="left" style="float:left; width:49%">
		<ul>
			<li>I believe in transparency and public sharing of scientific results / understanding, even
				if the primary audience is other scientists</li>
			<li>My (admittedly) ivory tower perspective highlights the critical need to preserve scientific accuracy
				over falling prey to well meaning propaganda</li>
