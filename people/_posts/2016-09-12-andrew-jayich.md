I'm an assistant professor at [UC Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu/) in the [Department of Physics](http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/). I study fundamental symmetries and quantum chemical reactions.

I received my bachelor's degree from Harvard University and my PhD Yale University, advised by [Jack Harris](http://harrislab.yale.edu/).  Following my PhD I did a postdoc for [Wes Campbell](http://campbellgroup.physics.ucla.edu/), where we laser cooled and trapped atoms with an optical frequency comb.
