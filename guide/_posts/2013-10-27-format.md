## Team

Each team member has a Markdown file in [`team/_posts/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/team/_posts).  File names are join date followed by first and last name, like [`2013-09-30-trevor-bedford.md`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/blob/master/team/_posts/2013-09-30-trevor-bedford.md).  YAML follows:

```
---
layout: member
title: Trevor Bedford
position: Principal investigator
handle: trvrb
email: trvrb@trevorbedford.com
twitter: trvrb
github: trvrb
image: /images/team/trevor-bedford.jpg
cv: /pdfs/team/bedford-cv.pdf
---
```

Tags `layout`, `title`, `last name`, `position`, `handle`, `image` are required, while `twitter`, `github`, `cv` are optional.  The image should be a 260x260 pixel tile.  All member images and PDFs should be placed in [`images/team/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/images/team) and [`pdfs/team/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/pdfs/team) respectively.
