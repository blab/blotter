## news

Each news post is a Markdown file in [`news/_posts/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/news/_posts).  File names have post date and a short title.  The short title is used for permanent URL links, so must be unique to each news post.  For example: [`2012-02-20-github-of-science.md`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/blob/master/news/_posts/2012-02-20-github-of-science.md).  Posts have the following YAML top matter:

```
---
layout: post
title: Some thoughts on a GitHub of Science
author: Trevor Bedford
image: /images/news/github_large.png
---
```

Tags `layout`, `title` and `author` are required, while `image` is optional.  The author name should correspond to the people member `title` tag for proper linking of posts to authors.  All news images should live in [`images/news/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/images/news) and be referred as relative to the base directory, begining with `/images/`.

## papers

Each paper lives in [`papers/_posts/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/papers/_posts).  File names, used to construct permalinks, are first author plus short (1-2 word) title, for example [`2012-04-30-bedford-canalization.md`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/blob/master/papers/_posts/2012-04-30-bedford-canalization.md).   papers have the following YAML metadata:

```
---
layout: paper
title: Canalization of the evolutionary trajectory of the human influenza virus
image: /images/papers/bedford-canalization.png
authors: Bedford T, Rambaut A, Pascual M.
year: 2012
ref: Bedford et al. 2012.
journal: "BMC Biol 10: 38."
pdf: /pdfs/papers/bedford-canalization.pdf
supplement: /pdfs/papers/bedford-canalization-supp.pdf
github: http://github.com/trvrb/canalization
---
```

Tags `layout`, `title`, `image`, `authors`, `year`, `ref`, `journal` are required.  Tags `pdf`, `supplement`, `github` are optional.  The image should be a 120x120 pixel tile.  All paper images and PDFs should reside in [`images/papers/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/images/papers) and [`pdfs/papers/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/pdfs/papers) respectively.

## Projects

Each project exists as a separate git repository.  To add a project and have it automatically redeploy when the project's GitHub repo is updated requires the following two steps:

### 1. Add the project to the Jekyll index

Open the file [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/blob/master/_config.yml) and append the full repo name to the YAML `projects` listing.  This should then look like:

```
projects:
  - trvrb/coaltrace
  - trvrb/stem
  ...
  - owner/project-name
```

where `owner` and `project-name` is specific to the new project.  Commit this change to the [blotter](https://github.com/blab/blotter) GitHub repo. 

### 2. Set a webhook from GitHub 

From the project repo, go to Settings / Service Hooks / WebHook URLs, and add `http://blotter-hook.herokuapp.com/` to the list.

## people

Each people member has a Markdown file in [`people/_posts/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/people/_posts).  File names are join date followed by first and last name, like [`2013-09-30-trevor-bedford.md`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/blob/master/people/_posts/2013-09-30-trevor-bedford.md).  YAML follows:

```
---
layout: member
title: Trevor Bedford
position: Principal investigator
handle: trvrb
email: trvrb@trevorbedford.com
twitter: trvrb
github: trvrb
image: /images/people/trevor-bedford.jpg
cv: /pdfs/people/bedford-cv.pdf
---
```

Tags `layout`, `title`, `last name`, `position`, `handle`, `image` are required, while `twitter`, `github`, `cv` are optional.  The image should be a 260x260 pixel tile.  All member images and PDFs should be placed in [`images/people/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/images/people) and [`pdfs/people/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/pdfs/people) respectively.
