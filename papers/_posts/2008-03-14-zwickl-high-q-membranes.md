# Abstract

We have measured the optical and mechanical loss of commercial silicon nitride membranes. We find that $50 nm$ thick, $1 mm^2$ membranes have mechanical $Q>10^6$ at $293 K$, and $Q>10^7$ at $300 mK$, well above what has been observed in devices with comparable dimensions. The near-IR optical loss at $293 K$ is less than $2×10^−4$. This combination of properties make these membranes attractive candidates for studying quantum effects in optomechanical systems.
