# Abstract

We develop the general nonequilibrium theory of transport through a quantum dot, including Coulomb blockade effects via a \\(1/N\\) expansion, where \\(N\\) is the number of scattering channels. At lowest order we recover the Landauer formula for the current plus a self-consistent equation for the dot potential. We obtain the leading corrections and compare with earlier approaches. Finally, we show that to leading and to next leading order in \\(1/N\\) there is no interaction correction to the weak localization, in contrast to previous theories, but consistent with experiments by Huibers _et al_. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1917 (1998)], where \\(N=4\\).
