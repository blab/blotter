# Abstract

A mutation in the Ebola virus glycoprotein arose early during the 2013-2016 epidemic and dominated
the viral population. Two studies by Diehl et al. and Urbanowicz et al. now reveal that this
mutation is associated with higher infectivity to human cells, representing the clearest example
of Ebola’s functional adaptation to human hosts.
