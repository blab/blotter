            We present an unsupervised learning model that adopts a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) that can be trained with unpaired turbulence data for super-resolution reconstruction
            Our model successfully reconstructs the high-resolution flow field of statistical DNS quality from the LES data.
            Furthermore, we find that the present model has almost universal applicability to all values of Reynolds numbers within the tested range.

            Prediction of 2D Turbulent Flows using Deep Learning
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="research-note text-start">
            Prediction of turbulence behavior has important implications
            for various applications
            such as flow control and turbulence modeling.
            In this study, the prediction of 2D Decaying Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (DHIT)
            has been conducted using deep learning.
            We trained one of the latest network models,
            called conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs),
            using datasets produced by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)
            to make the predictions possible
            to reflect the correlation between the input and output.
            By comparing the predictive accuracy
            according to the prediction time distance,
            we confirmed that a satisfactory level of prediction
            can be achieved for a time distance
            of the integral time scale,
            where the autocorrelation drops to around 0.25.

            Indoor flow analysis is investigated using Immersed Boundary Method(IBM) coupled LES.
            Contaminant transport by infiltration or leakage flow need to be analyzed
            to understand how to prepare for chemical or biological agent.
            Indoor environments which consist of various objects are demonstrated using IBM
            to efficiently handle complex geometries.
            The immersed boundaries in this application are constructed
            with sets of lagrangian point which independently applied the directional forces
            on each x, y, z directions to get desired velocity more precisely.
            And, all these implementations are conducted on GPU system for real-time prediction.

            Ellipsoid Particle Rotation in Isotropic Turbulence with Gravity

            By expanding the analysis of spherical particles laden
            in isotropic turbulence,
            which has been widely used in previous studies,
            a more realistic ellipsoidal point particle analysis was conducted.
            This is to examine the behavior of ellipsoidal particles observed
            in a more realistic natural environment
            than the spherical particle assumption used in previous studies.
            The behavior of the particles that settle
            when gravity is applied was observed, and the difference
            between the particles and the spherical particles was observed.
            When rod or disk-like particles were suspended in the turbulent flow,
            it was confirmed
            that the particle clustering tendency was different from that of the sphere,
            and there is a big difference in the main alignment direction
            of the particles.

            Rayleigh-Bérnard convection can be found in many natural phenomena and has been widely applied in industrial fields using heat transfer.
            In particular, RB convection, in which particles or bubbles float,
            is a subject that requires research because it is difficult to investigate the mechanism.
            The particles affecting the flow were considered heavy particles and bubbles
            modeled as point particles.
            As the particles interact with the fluid, they induce turbulence and plume,
            creating polygonal cells, a characteristic characteristic of RB convection.

            Path Instability of a No-slip Spheroidal Bubble in Isotropic Turbulence
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="research-note text-start text-md-end">
            Path instability of a millimetric spheroidal bubble in quiescent fluid and in isotropic turbulence
            is investigated by direct numerical simulation. An immersed boundary method along with a new
            formulation of the equation of bubble motion is utilized to impose the no-slip condition on the surface
            of an air bubble in fixed shape with the equivalent diameter of 1.0 ~ 4.0mm in contaminated water.
            In still fluid, as the bubble size grows,
            the frequency of the zigzagging motion of the bubble increases while the range in the orientation
            angle variation of the bubble is hardly affected. The effect of background turbulence on path
            instability of a rising bubble, which typically shows zigzag pattern in still
            fluid, is investigated at three different Reynolds numbers of 26, 45 and 73.
            When a bubble rises in isotropic turbulence,
            the terminal rise velocity of the bubble do not show a noticeable difference. However, the pathways
            are significantly distorted by turbulence. Furthermore, the magnitude of zigzagging frequency and
            the degree of obliquity of the bubble become enhanced with Reynolds number. We also observed wakes behind
            the bubble to find that the rear tails become weaker and tangled due to turbulence.

            Modification of Turbulence and Stratification of Stably Stratified Turbulent Channel Flows by Finite-size Particles
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="research-note text-start">
            Direct numerical simulations are carried out
            for thermally stratified turbulent channel flow
            laden with finite-size particles
            using an immersed boundary method that was developed
            for use in nonuniform grids.
            Particles are neutrally buoyant or slightly heavier than fluids.
            We find that neutrally buoyant particles
            make the internal gravity waves stronger.
            The vertical motion of the particles is limited
            to each half of the channel due to the gravity wave,
            which acts as a wall at the center of the channel.
            If the particles are slightly heavier than the fluid,
            the turbulence structures are greatly modified by the particles.
            The particle movements in the near-wall and core regions are
            statistically analyzed using particle velocities or residence times,
            and individual particle movements are presented.
            The particles stay in the high-speed streak region for a relatively long time
            and disappear rapidly in the near-wall region
            when encountering the ejection event of the turbulent flow.
            Analysis of the vortex structure with the heat flux shows
            that the particles play a role in suppressing the vertical heat transport.
            Additional budget analysis of heat flux is performed
            for a detailed investigation.
