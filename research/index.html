            High Fidelity Indoor Dispersion Analysis Using LES/IBM

        <div class="research-note text-start text-md-end">
            Indoor flow analysis is investigated using Immersed Boundary Method(IBM) coupled LES.
            Contaminant transport by infiltration or leakage flow need to be analyzed
            to understand how to prepare for chemical or biological agent.
            Indoor environments which consist of various objects are demonstrated using IBM
            to efficiently handle complex geometries.
            The immersed boundaries in this application are constructed
            with sets of lagrangian point which independently applied the directional forces
            on each x, y, z directions to get desired velocity more precisely.
            And, all these implementations are conducted on GPU system for real-time prediction.

            Simulation of the Mushroom Cloud Generated from a High-energy Explosion
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="research-note text-start">
            We performed numerical simulations of a 20 kT heavy explosion to predict the
            rise and diffusion of mushroom cloud after the atmospheric pressure is recovered around the
            burst point. We proposed a new formulation of governing equations based on the anelastic
            approximation and density weighted variables to implement the atmospheric stratification by
            employing potential temperature to account for the effect of atmospheric pressure variation in
            altitude.

            Ellipsoid Particle Rotation in Isotropic Turbulence with Gravity
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="research-note text-start text-md-end">
            By expanding the analysis of spherical particles laden in isotropic turbulence, which has been widely used in previous studies, a more realistic ellipsoidal point particle analysis was conducted. This is to examine the behavior of ellipsoidal particles observed in a more realistic natural environment than the spherical particle assumption used in previous studies. The behavior of the particles that settle when gravity is applied was observed, and the difference between the particles and the spherical particles was observed. When rod or disk-like particles were suspended in the turbulent flow, it was confirmed that the particle clustering tendency was different from that of the sphere, and there is a big difference in the main alignment direction of the particles.

            Path instability of a no-slip spheroidal bubble in isotropic turbulence
        </div>

        <div class="research-note text-start text-md-end">
            Path instability of a millimetric spheroidal bubble in quiescent fluid and in isotropic turbulence
            is investigated by direct numerical simulation. An immersed boundary method along with a new
            formulation of the equation of bubble motion is utilized to impose the no-slip condition on the surface
            of an air bubble in fixed shape with the equivalent diameter of 1.0 ~ 4.0mm in contaminated water.
            In still fluid, as the bubble size grows,
            the frequency of the zigzagging motion of the bubble increases while the range in the orientation
            angle variation of the bubble is hardly affected. The effect of background turbulence on path
            instability of a rising bubble, which typically shows zigzag pattern in still
            fluid, is investigated at three different Reynolds numbers of 26, 45 and 73.
            When a bubble rises in isotropic turbulence,
            the terminal rise velocity of the bubble do not show a noticeable difference. However, the pathways
            are signicantly distorted by turbulence. Furthermore, the magnitude of zigzagging frequency and
            the degree of obliquity of the bubble become enhanced with Reynolds number. We also observed wakes behind
            the bubble to find that the rear tails become weaker and tangled due to turbulence.
