# Development

## Build

The site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  This allows the site to be [versioned on GitHub](https://github.com/blab/blotter/commits/master) and, importantly, allows anyone with commit access to the GitHub repository to easily contribute.

Content is stored as simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) files with a bit of [YAML](http://yaml.org/) at the top.  This keeps content mostly semantic and can be easily processed.


## Deploy

Deployment is done to an [GitHub](https://github.com/turbulencelab/turbulencelab.github.io), using [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions). GitHub Action script is written under [.github/workflows](https://github.com/turbulencelab/turbulencelab.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekylll-gh-pages.yml). Deployment will start automatically when commits are pushed into GitHub repo.
