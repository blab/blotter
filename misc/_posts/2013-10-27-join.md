*We are currently prioritizing a [postdoc in immune repertoire dynamics](/news/postdoc-repertoire-dynamics/). If this is you, please drop me an email.*

However, we're always looking for people who take a quantitative approach to studying biology and evolution.  Particular emphasis is placed on evolution, epidemiology, virology and immunology, and especially their intersection.  If you think you may be interested, please [get in touch](http://bedford.io/misc/contact/).

## Graduate students

Graduate students from the [MCB program](https://depts.washington.edu/mcb/) and the [Epidemiology program](http://depts.washington.edu/epidem/doctor-philosophy-phd) of the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) can join the group.  Rotation students are welcome.
