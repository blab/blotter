## Build site

To build the website locally, clone the repo and change into the repo's directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/blab/blotter.git
cd blotter/
```

Install the latest version of Ruby supported by blotter using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to work around any system-wide Ruby installations that may be incompatible.

``` bash
rbenv install
```

Check that `gem` is available through the rbenv installation.
If it is not, consult the rbenv documentation above to resolve the issue.

``` bash
which gem
```

Install bundler.

``` bash
gem install bundler
```

Install blotter's Ruby dependencies.

``` bash
bundle install
```

Build the site.

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are getting errors at this stage, it may be due to your version of `bundle`.
> Try `gem uninstall bundler` + `gem install bundler -v 1.13.1`.

Start a local Jekyll server to view the site.

``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000/`. More information on Jekyll can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/).

To include projects, preprocessing scripts are necessary to clone project repos and update Jekyll metadata. This can be accomplished with:

```
ruby _scripts/update-and-preprocess.rb
```

Then `jekyll build` works as normal.

## Contribute

Blog posts just require YAML top matter that looks something like:

```
---
layout: post
title: Newton Institute presentation
author: Trevor Bedford
link: http://www.newton.ac.uk/programmes/IDD/seminars/2013082213301.html
image: /images/blog/transmission.png
---
```

The `layout`, `title` and `author` tags are required, while `link` and `image` are optional.  Just save a Markdown file with this top matter as something like `blog/_posts/2013-08-27-newton-institute.md`, where `2013-08-27` is the date of the post and `newton-institute` is the short title.  This short title is used in the URL of the post, so this becomes `blog/newton-institute/`, so the short title should be long enough and unique enough not to cause conflicts with other posts.
