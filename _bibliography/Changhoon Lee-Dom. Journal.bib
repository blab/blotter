@article{Kang1989,
abstract = {Viscous flows through the screen normal to the uniform flow are numerically simulated and measuments of the mean velocity are made. Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved with a standard k-$\epsilon$ model. The existence of screen is regarded as extra sources in the momentum equations. The amount of extra source is related to the resistance coeffcient and the refraction coefficient of the screen. Elliptic type of equations are solved for 2 dimensional flow, and the partially parabolic equations for 3 dimensional flows. Wakes behind 3 dimensional mesh-screens of various configurations have been measured in the cavitation tunnel. The present numerical method is verifed to reasonably simulate the viscous wake of the screen, for wihich the inviscid theory is quite limited. Considerable attenuations of the viscous shear layer in th wake of the screen are experimentally observed and numerically simulated. A detached separation-bubble from the two-dimensional screen is simulated as the resistance coeffcient is increased to a certain level. {\textcopyright} 1989, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers (KSME).

@article{Park2010,
abstract = {The effect of a particle's spin is investigated numerically by taking into account the effect of lift forces originating due to difference between the rotations of a particle and of a fluid, such as the Saffman and Magnus lift forces. These lift forces have been ignored in many previous studies on particle-laden turbulence. The trajectory of the particles can be changed by the lift forces, resulting in a significant modification of the stochastic characteristics of heavy particles. Probability density functions and autocorrelations are evaluated from the velocity of solid particle, acceleration of solid particles, and acceleration of fluid at the position of solid particle. Changes in velocity statistics are negligible but statistics related with acceleration are affected by the rotation of particle. When a laden particle encounters coherent structures during its motion, the particle's rotation might significantly affects the motion due to intermittently large fluid acceleration near the coherent structures.},
