abstract = {A novel immersed boundary (IB) method based on an implicit direct forcing (IDF) scheme is developed for incompressible viscous flows. The key idea for the present IDF method is to use a block LU decomposition technique in momentum equations with Taylor series expansion to construct the implicit IB forcing in a recurrence form, which imposes more accurate no-slip boundary conditions on the IB surface. To accelerate the IB forcing convergence during the iterative procedure, a pre-conditioner matrix is introduced in the recurrence formulation of the IB forcing. A Jacobi-type parameter is determined in the pre-conditioner matrix by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the matrix function representing the difference between the IB forcing solution matrix and the pre-conditioner matrix. In addition, the pre-conditioning parameter is restricted due to the numerical stability in the recurrence formulation. Consequently, the present pre-conditioned IDF (PIDF) enables accurate calculation of the IB forcing within a few iterations. We perform numerical simulations of two-dimensional flows around a circular cylinder and three-dimensional flows around a sphere for low and moderate Reynolds numbers. The result shows that PIDF yields a better imposition of no-slip boundary conditions on the IB surfaces for low Reynolds number with a fairly larger time step than IB methods with different direct forcing schemes due to the implicit treatment of the diffusion term for determining the IB forcing. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of the present PIDF scheme by numerical simulations of flow around a circular array of cylinders, flows around a falling sphere, and two sedimenting spheres in gravity.},

abstract = {The current paper examines the heavy particle statistics modification by two-way interaction in particle-laden isotropic turbulence in an attempt to interpret their statistics modification using the information of modulated turbulence. Moreover, we clarify the distinctions of this modification between decaying and stationary turbulence as an extension of our previous work [A. H. Abdelsamie and C. Lee, "Decaying versus stationary turbulence in particle-laden isotropic turbulence: Turbulence modulation mechanism," Phys. Fluids24, 015106 (2012)10.1063/1.3678332]. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) was carried out using 1283 grid points at a Taylor micro-scale Reynolds number of R$\lambda$ $\sim$ 70. The effect of O(106) solid particles with a different Stokes number (St) was implemented as a point-force approximation in the Navier-Stokes equation. Various statistics associated with particle dispersion are investigated, and the auto-correlations models which was provided by Jung et al. ["Behavior of heavy particles in isotropic turbulence," Phys. Rev. E77, 016307 (2008)10.1103/PhysRevE.77.016307] are extended in the current paper. DNS results reveal that the two-way coupling interaction enhances the fluid and heavy particle auto-correlation functions and the alignment between their velocity vectors for all Stokes numbers in decaying and stationary turbulence, but for different reasons. The modification mechanisms of particle dispersion statistics in stationary turbulence are different from those in decaying turbulence depending on the Stokes number, particularly for St <1. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations are carried out for thermally stratified turbulent channel flow laden with finite-size particles using an immersed boundary method that was developed for use in nonuniform grids. We consider the stratification effect at friction Richardson numbers Ri$\tau$=0 and 20 with a friction Reynolds number Re$\tau$=180. The particle diameter is chosen as 0.21$\delta$ and the global volume fraction of the particles ranges between 0 and 8%, where $\delta$ is the channel half gap. Particles are neutrally buoyant or slightly heavier than fluids. We find that neutrally buoyant particles make the internal gravity waves stronger. The vertical motion of the particles is limited to each half of the channel due to the gravity wave, which acts as a wall at the center of the channel. If the particles are slightly heavier than the fluid, the turbulence structures are greatly modified by the particles. The particle movements in the near-wall and core regions are statistically analyzed using particle velocities or residence times, and individual particle movements are presented. The particles stay in the high-speed streak region for a relatively long time and disappear rapidly in the near-wall region when encountering the ejection event of the turbulent flow. Analysis of the vortex structure with the heat flux shows that the particles play a role in suppressing the vertical heat transport. Additional budget analysis of heat flux is performed for a detailed investigation.},

abstract = {Turbulent channel flows laden with particles are investigated using direct numerical simulation with a point-force approximation for small, heavy particles with a diameter smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale of the flow. The Stokes numbers based on the wall units considered in our study are St+ = 0.5, 5, 35, and 125. The main purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Stokes number on turbulence modification in a channel. We found that particles with St+ = 0.5 enhance turbulence by increasing the occurrence of quasistreamwise vortices, while larger-Stokes-number particles attenuate turbulence. Particles with St+ = 0.5 act as an energy source in the streamwise direction in the high-speed regions and low-speed streaks near the wall, which may increase the instability of the low-speed streaks responsible for the birth of new quasistreamwise vortices. However, particles that have been just swept into the low-speed streaks with a long memory due to turbophoresis act as an energy sink in the streamwise direction. This streamwise interaction is maximized for St+ = 35. On the other hand, maximum preferential concentration outside vortical regions occurs when St+ = 5, but their streamwise interaction with the fluid is weak, rather similarly to the case of St+ = 0.5. Thus, the turbulence is less suppressed than St+ = 35.},

Blood flow in arteries is an important phenomenon from biological and medical point of view. No one can survive without blood flow in tapered arteries. Blood flow is the continuous running of blood in the cardiovascular system. The human body is made up of several processes all carrying out various functions. We have the gastrointestinal system which aids the digestion and the absorption of food. We also have the respiratory system which is responsible for the absorption of O2 and elimination of CO2. The urinary system removes waste from the body. The cardiovascular system helps to distribute food, O 2 and other products of metabolism. The reproductive system is responsible for perpetuating the species. The nervous and endocrine system is responsible for coordinating the integration and functions of other system. The equations govern the flow for considered model are presented in cylindrical coordinates. Perturbation solutions are developed in terms of small Eyring Prandtl fluid parameter $\beta$ for the velocity, impedance resistance, wall shear stress and shearing stress at the stenosis throat. Three types of arteries i.e converging, diverging and non-tapered arteries have been considered for the analysis and discussion. Graphical results have been presented for different physical parameters of the flow problem. Streamlines have been plotted at the end of the article.

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow at low Reynolds number (Re$\tau$ = 100,200,400, where Re$\tau$ is the Reynolds number based on the wall-shear velocity and channel half-width) are carried out to examine the effectiveness of using the Lorentz force to reduce skin friction. The Lorentz force is created by embedding electrodes and permanent magnets in the flat surface over which the flow passes. Both open-loop and closed-loop control schemes are examined. For open-loop control, both temporally and spatially oscillating Lorentz forces in the near-wall region are tested. It is found that skin-friction drag can be reduced by approximately 40% if a temporally oscillating spanwise Lorentz force is applied to a Re$\tau$=100 channel flow. However, the power to generate the required Lorentz force is an order of magnitude larger than the power saved due to the reduced drag. Simulations were carried out at higher Reynolds numbers (Re$\tau$ =200,400) to determine whether efficiency, defined as the ratio of the power saved to the power used, improves with increasing Reynolds number. We found that the efficiency decreases with increasing Reynolds number. An idealized wall-normal Lorentz force is effected by detecting the near-wall turbulent events responsible for high-skin friction. It is found that the drag can be significantly reduced with a greater efficiency than that produced by the spanwise open-loop control approach. This result suggests that, when employed with a closed-loop control scheme, the Lorentz force might result in a net decrease of power required to propel objects through viscous conducting fluids. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The behaviour of fluid-particle acceleration in near-wall turbulent flows is investigated in numerically simulated turbulent channel flows at low to moderate Reynolds numbers, Re$\tau$ = 180∼600). The acceleration is decomposed into pressure-gradient (irrotational) and viscous contributions (solenoidal acceleration) and the statistics of each component are analysed. In near-wall turbulent flows, the probability density function of acceleration is strongly dependent on the distance from the wall. Unexpectedly, the intermittency of acceleration is strongest in the viscous sublayer, where the acceleration flatness factor of O(100) is observed. It is shown that the centripetal acceleration around coherent vortical structures is an important source of the acceleration intermittency. We found sheet-like structures of strong solenoidal accelerations near the wall, which are associated with the background shear modified by the interaction between a streamwise vortex and the wall. We found that the acceleration Kolmogorov constant is a linear function of y+ in the log layer.

abstract = {Information centric networking is one of the most promising future Internet architectures to tackle the increasing network traffic by enabling in-network caching to cache popular contents. Although in-network caching reduces the network traffic by providing requested content locally to the users, several challenging issues are still unsolved. For example, identical contents are replicated in all routers along each request's forwarding path, which incurs faster cache replacement and degrades cache utilization, and temporally cached content's locations are not easy to track or search in the network. Besides, it is tough to correctly predict future popularity of contents and decide which contents to store. Hence, in this paper, an online caching and cooperative forwarding scheme is proposed to enhance cache utilization and to reduce network delay, as well as reduce the workload on each router. The caching problem is formulated as a Ski-Rental problem, which is a classical method for online decision making, in combination with consistent-hashing to obtain an online coordinated caching solution. The proposed request forwarding scheme is based on consistent-hashing, where every router knows the potential location of the cached copy of the requested content and thereby avoiding the unnecessary forwarding. Finally, the proposed request forwarding and caching schemes were validated by a chunk-level simulator. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of content hit rate, server load, the processing load on routers, and access delay.},

Recognizing that a great portion of production of vorticity occurs in the viscous sublayer, a body force is used to suppress spanwise velocity in the sublayer, and a significant amount of drag reduction is obtained. A more realistic body force or wall movement in the spanwise direction using instantaneous wall-shear stress in a closed-loop control is shown to reduce drag as much as 35%. Implementation of such a body force using an electromagnetic force is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The Lagrangian dispersion of fluid particles in inhomogeneous turbulence is investigated by a direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow. Lagrangian velocity and acceleration along a particle trajectory are computed by employing several interpolation schemes. Among the schemes tested, the four-point Hermite interpolation in the homogeneous directions combined with Chebyshev polynomials in the wall-normal direction seems to produce most reliable Lagrangian statistics. Inhomogeneity of Lagrangian statistics in turbulent boundary layer is investigated by releasing many particles at several different wall-normal locations and tracking those particles. The fluid particle dispersion and Lagrangian structure function of velocity are investigated for the Kolmogorov similarity. The behavior of the Lagrangian integral time scales, Kolmogorov constants a0 and C0 of the velocity structure function near the wall are discussed. The intermittent behavior of the fluid particle acceleration is also examined by kurtosis of the Lagrangian structure function. Finally, the effect of the initial particle location on the dispersion is analyzed by the probability density function of particle position at several downstream locations. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

Intermittently found acceleration of large magnitude always points towards the rotational axis of a vortex filament, indicating that the intermittency of acceleration is associated with the rotational motion of the vortices that causes centripetal acceleration, which is consistent with the reported result for the near-wall turbulence. Furthermore, investigation on movements of such vortex filaments provides some insights into the dynamics of local dissipation, enstrophy and acceleration. Strong dissipation partially covering the edge of a vortex filament shows weak correlation with enstrophy, while it is strongly correlated with acceleration. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We report an extensive theoretical and numerical study of gravitational settling of small particles in a stratified fluid at rest. The particle motion creates a flow that advects the stratified agent, which in turn impacts the velocity by buoyancy. A peculiar insulation flow also exists when a particle and fluid at infinity are at rest, screening the particle from the outside gradients. We derive an integral representation for the linear coupled flow that holds at low Reynolds and P{\'{e}}clet numbers. The representation demonstrates that the far flow contains a previously unnoticed term that is produced by the thermal component of the fundamental solution. We obtain nontrivial symmetry relations that constitute a form of the Onsager reciprocal relations. Stratification is a singular perturbation: however small it is, far from the particle the flow is fast decaying and does not obey the slow power-law decay of the Stokes flow at zero stratification. We derive the enhancement of the drag force due to the stratification by adopting the integral equation on the surface traction. This allows one to find the force directly, circumventing finding the flow whose calculation demands the matched asymptotic expansions that complicated previous studies. In this way we are able to extend the domain of validity of the drag formula by orders of magnitude. We confirm the predictions by numerical simulations at low Reynolds numbers. We also performed simulations for a range of non-small Reynolds numbers where the flow is nonlinear, but the Reynolds number is not too large. The considered range of parameters demonstrates that inclusion of stratification might be necessary for correct prediction of the sedimentation velocity of plankton particles and small organic particles of marine snow. We provide the settling velocity of Volvox as an example. We sum up our observations by deriving an empirical fitting formula for the drag coefficient. Finally, we discuss the observability of the insulating flow around a floating body.},

abstract = {Present study is devoted to investigate the Casson fluid flow phenomena over an exponentially stretching surface at the heated wall. The stresses defined for Casson fluid model are reduced in the form of partial differential equations via boundary layer approximation and then converted into the system of nonlinear ODEs by means of similarity transformation. Present Casson fluid model is tackled via three different techniques: in which the numerical results are obtained through Runge–Kutta Felburge method and verified these results with the help of homotopy analysis method and modified technique known as optimal homotopy analysis method. Graphical comparisons and numerical tables are constructed to validate the results for three different techniques. The effects of each emerging parameters on velocity and temperature profiles are demonstrated through graphs. Moreover, skin friction and Nusselt number are also calculated and also provide the comparison between Newtonian fluid and non-Newtonian fluid. It is concluded that non-Newtonian fluid shows the higher skin friction coefficient as compared to Newtonian fluid, while the Nusselt number is more dominant for Newtonian case as compared to non-Newtonian case for different values of temperature exponent. Temperature exponent also play a significant role in heat transfer within the boundary layer domain.},

abstract = {We performed numerical simulations of blast wave propagations on surfaces by solving axisymmetric two-dimensional Euler equations. Assuming the initial stage of fireball at the breakaway point after an explosion, we investigated the effect of surface conditions considering surface convex or concave elements and thermal conditions on blast wave propagations near the ground surface. Parametric studies were performed by varying the geometrical factors of the surface element as well as thermal layer characteristics. We found that the peak overpressure near the ground zero was increased due to the surface elements, while modulations of the blast wave propagations were limited within a region for the surface elements. Because of the thermal layer, the precursor was formed in the propagations, which led to the attenuation of the peak overpressure on the ground surface.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanism controlling the particle motion in flow over a complex boundary is of great importance for many engineering fields. It is well known that fluid flowing over a wavy boundary creates turbulence that is remarkably different from the flow over a flat wall. Previous studies have presented the role of vortical structures over a wavy boundary, which is associated with particle clustering near the boundary. In this study, behavior of particles in turbulence over a wavy wall is investigated by direct numerical simulation of a turbulent wavy channel flow with laden particles. Our investigation shows that particles interact selectively with vortical structures and accumulate in a specific region along the wavy wall. Active deposition and resuspension occur in the upslope region where streamwise vortices are concentrated. Depending on the particle Stokes number and waviness of the wall, a strip or streak pattern of particle clustering near the wall is observed due to the combined effect of the wavy wall and vortical structures. However, due to the particle inertia, particle velocity and its fluctuation do not change as much as fluid velocity along the wavy boundary. Statistics and relevant physical interpretations of particle motion are presented.},

Fluid Mech. 558, 309 (2006)], the stability of a channel flow subject to wall blowing and suction in the form of a traveling wave is investigated by combined use of the Floquet analysis, direct numerical simulation, and singular value decomposition analysis. Results show that stability highly depends on the phase speed of the traveling wave; most disturbances become highly unstable when the phase speed is around 40% of the centerline velocity, while streamwise streak-type three-dimensional disturbances become stabilized with transient growth suppressed when the phase speed exceeds the centerline velocity for both subcritical and supercritical Reynolds numbers. This destabilization is interpreted by investigation of wave interactions. An upstream-traveling wave, which reduces mean drag, does not stabilize the flow. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

In the near-wall region, large-scale motions are suppressed by stable stratification, while small-scale motions are enhanced, which leads to the increase of intermittency. It is shown that the modification of the Reynolds shear stress is caused by the increased intermittency and anisotropy. Investigation of acceleration and vorticity reveals that the length scales and timescales of the near-wall coherent vortices are reduced by stratification. The role of baroclinic torque around the near-wall turbulent structures is also discussed. The Lagrangian statistics indicate that the scaled dispersion in the streamwise direction remains unchanged, while those in the spanwise as well as in the wall-normal direction are suppressed by stratification.},

The governing equations of hyperbolic tangent fluid in cylindrical coordinates were modeled. Heat and mass transfer phenomena were taken into consideration. The resulting nonlinear momentum, energy, and mass equations were simplified using long wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations. The resulting problem was solved using two analytical techniques, a regular perturbation method in terms of a variant of the Weissenberg number, and a homotopy analysis method. A graphical comparison of both of the solutions is presented for velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles. The expressions for axial velocity, temperature, mass concentration, heat and mass transfer coefficients, and axial pressure gradient were obtained, and the effects of various emerging parameters on these flow characteristics are illustrated graphically. The writers graphically demonstrate the numerical results for the pressure rise and frictional force for different waveforms (sinusoidal, multi-sinusoidal, triangular, square, and trapezoidal).

The asymmetric coupling force on vortical structures generates horizontal force gradients, transiently enhancing the flow vorticity, while the cumulative buoyant transfer induced by bubbles in the downflow regions decreases it by attenuating the horizontal gradients of the downward flow velocity. These vorticity fluctuations affect the non-uniform distortion in the flow dissipation spectrum with a large-scale energy reduction, decreasing the flow dissipation. In addition, the buoyancy force acting on the bubbles affects the bubble distribution. Smaller inhomogeneities in the bubble distribution with turbulence attenuation, owing to the two-way coupling effects, also contribute to the bubble dispersion.},

The particles are dragged by the flow by linear friction force. We demonstrate that the pair-correlation function of particles' concentration diverges with decreasing separation as a power law with negative exponent. This manifests fractal distribution of particles in space. We find that the exponent is proportional to ratio of integral of energy spectrum of turbulence times the wave number over g. The proportionality coefficient is a universal number independent of particle size. We derive the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents that describes the evolution of small patches of particles. It is demonstrated that particles separate dominantly in the horizontal plane. This provides a theory for the recently observed vertical columns formed by the particles. We confirm the predictions by direct numerical simulations of Navier-Stokes turbulence. The predictions include conditions that hold for water droplets in warm clouds thus providing a tool for the prediction of rain formation.},

abstract = {We present the point of view that both the vortices and the east-west zonal winds of Jupiter are confined to the planet's shallow weather layer and that their dynamics is completely described by the weakly dissipated, weakly forced quasigeostrophic (QG) equation. The weather layer is the region just below the tropopause and contains the visible clouds. The forcing mimics the overshoot of fluid from an underlying convection zone. The late-time solutions of the weakly forced and dissipated QG equations appear to be a small subset of the unforced and undissipated equations and are robust attractors. We illustrate QG vortex dynamics and attempt to explain the important features of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and other vortices: their shapes, locations with respect to the extrema of the east-west winds, stagnation points, numbers as a function of latitude, mergers, break-ups, cloud morphologies, internal distributions of vorticity, and signs of rotation with respect to both the planet's rotation and the shear of their surrounding east-west winds. Initial-value calculations in which the weather layer starts at rest produce oscillatory east-west winds. Like the Jovian winds, the winds are east-west asymmetric and have K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex streets located only at the west-going jets. From numerical calculations we present an empirically derived energy criterion that determines whether QG vortices survive in oscillatory zonal flows with nonzero potential vorticity gradients. We show that a recent proof that claims that all QG vortices decay when embedded in oscillatory zonal flows1 is too restrictive in its assumptions. We show that the asymmetries in the cloud morphologies and numbers of cyclones and anticyclones can be accounted for by a QG model of the Jovian atmosphere, and we compare the QG model with competing models. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {With the recent rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and wide applications in many areas, some fundamental questions in turbulence research can be addressed, such as: ‘Can turbulence be learned by AI? If so, how and why?' In order to provide answers to these questions, we applied deep learning to the prediction of turbulent heat transfer based only on wall information using data obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flow. Through this attempt, we investigated whether deep learning could help to improve our understanding of the physics of turbulent heat transfer. Under the assumption that the wall-normal local heat flux can be explicitly expressed through a multilayer nonlinear network in terms of the nearby wall-shear stresses and wall pressure fluctuations, we applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the local heat flux. After optimizing the network hyperparameters using a grid searching method, we found that the network can predict the heat flux very accurately with a correlation coefficient of 0.980 between the DNS and the prediction by CNN for the trained Reynolds number, $Re_{\unicode[STIX]{x1D70F}}=180$ , and shows similar accuracy at a Reynolds number three times higher than the trained number. This result indicates that relationships between the local heat flux and the nearby inputs are quite insensitive to the Reynolds number within the tested range. In addition, observing the gradient maps of the trained network, we identified the part of the input data that is essential for the local heat flux prediction and the spatial relationship between the local heat flux and the nearby input fields. In addition to obtaining an understanding of the underlying physics, we investigated whether our model could be utilized for turbulence modelling.},

Swinney, Nature (London) 331, 689 (1989)] with a sloping bottom (that simulates a barotropic atmosphere's Coriolis force with a topographic $\beta$-effect [J. Pedlosky, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, 2nd ed. (Springer, Berlin, 1986)]) produce eastward and westward jets, i.e., azimuthal flows moving in the same or opposite direction as the annulus' rotation. Flows are forced by pumping fluid in and out of two concentric slits in the bottom boundary and the direction of the jets depends on the direction of the pumping. The eastward and westward jets differ, with the former narrow, strong, and wavy. The jets of Jupiter and Saturn have the same east-west asymmetry [P. S. Marcus, Ann. Rev. Astron. Astro. 431, 523 (1993)]. Numerical simulations show that the azimuthally-averaged flow differs substantially from the non-averaged flow which has sharp gradients in the potential vorticity q. They also show that the maxima of the eastward jets and Rossby waves are located where the gradients of q are large, and the maxima of the westward jets and vortex chains are located where they are weak. As the forcing is increased the drift velocities of the two chains of vortices of the eastward jet lock together; whereas the two chains of the westward jet do not. Inspired by a previously published, [P. S. Marcus, Ann. Rev. Astron. Astro. 431, 523 (1993)] piece-wise constant-q model of the Jovian jets and based on numerical simulations, a new model of the experimental flow that is characterized by regions of undisturbed flow and bands of nearly uniform q separated by sharp gradients is presented. It explains the asymmetry of the laboratory jets and quantitatively describes all of the wave and vortex behavior in the experiments including the locking of the vortex chains of the eastward jet. The simulations and new model contradict the predictions of a competing, older model of the laboratory flow that is based on a Bickley jet; this raises concerns about previous calculations of Lagrangian mixing in the laboratory experiments that used the Bickley model for the fluid velocity. The new model, simulations and laboratory experiments all show that jets can be formed by the mixing and homogenization of q. The relevance of this to the jets of Jupiter is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Dynamic behaviors of spherical microbubbles, within a one-way coupling frame, in stratified turbulence are investigated by direct numerical simulation. To simulate stratified turbulence, the Navier-Stokes equations and heat equation with a background linear temperature variation are solved in a periodic cube domain. Stratification creates a predominantly horizontal motion in a fluid, thereby inducing the well-defined "quasi"mean oscillatory horizontal flow. By solving the equation of motion for microbubbles, we found that the clustering of bubbles with a Stokes number below 0.1 becomes weaker as the stratification is increased. Consequently, the reduction of rise velocity of bubbles in turbulence compared to that in still fluid decreases from 7% to 2%. Owing to the alternating mean motion of the fluid, bubbles rise in a zigzag pattern, thereby resulting in an oscillatory Lagrangian correlation of the horizontal velocity component of bubbles. Despite this oscillating rising motion of the bubbles, the horizontal dispersion of a single bubble is suppressed. From the statistics of the horizontal separation of pair bubbles, we observe a power-law growth in the Batchelor and Richardson regimes for the separation.},

abstract = {Recent attempts to use deep learning for super-resolution reconstruction of turbulent flows have used supervised learning, which requires paired data for training. This limitation hinders more practical applications of super-resolution reconstruction. Therefore, we present an unsupervised learning model that adopts a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) that can be trained with unpaired turbulence data for super-resolution reconstruction. Our model is validated using three examples: (i) recovering the original flow field from filtered data using direct numerical simulation (DNS) of homogeneous isotropic turbulence; (ii) reconstructing full-resolution fields using partially measured data from the DNS of turbulent channel flows; and (iii) generating a DNS-resolution flow field from large-eddy simulation (LES) data for turbulent channel flows. In examples (i) and (ii), for which paired data are available for supervised learning, our unsupervised model demonstrates qualitatively and quantitatively similar performance as that of the best supervised learning model. More importantly, in example (iii), where supervised learning is impossible, our model successfully reconstructs the high-resolution flow field of statistical DNS quality from the LES data. Furthermore, we find that the present model has almost universal applicability to all values of Reynolds numbers within the tested range. This demonstrates that unsupervised learning of turbulence data is indeed possible, opening a new door for the wide application of super-resolution reconstruction of turbulent fields.},

From these and the relevant investigation of frequency of the forced system, the optimum gains of the feedback forcing are suggested. Stability regimes of the Runge-Kutta schemes of various order are much wider than those of the Adams-Bashforth schemes. Specially, the third-order Runge-Kutta scheme allows the use of an order-one CFL number in the integration of the feedback forcing, rendering the method applicable to turbulent flows with complex boundaries.

abstract = {We performed two-way coupled direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow with Lagrangian tracking of small, heavy spheres at a dimensionless gravitational acceleration of 0.077 in wall units, which is based on the flow condition in the experiment by Gerashchenko et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 617, 2008, pp. 255-281). We removed deposited particles after several collisions with the lower wall and then released new particles near the upper wall to observe direct interactions between particles and coherent structures of near-wall turbulence during gravitational settling through the mean shear. The results indicate that when the Stokes number is approximately 1 on the basis of the Kolmogorov time scale of the flow (), the so-called preferential sweeping occurs in association with coherent streamwise vortices, while the effect of crossing trajectories becomes significant for 1$]]>. Consequently, in either case, the settling particles deposit on the wall without strong accumulation in low-speed streaks in the viscous sublayer. When particles settle through near-wall turbulence from the upper wall, more small-scale vortical structures are generated in the outer layer as low-speed fluid is pulled farther in the direction of gravity, while the opposite is true near the lower wall.},

Roughness parameters such as the roughness length z0 and zero-plane displacement d are extracted using a best-fit approximation of the measured wind velocity. We also perform a large-eddy simulation (LES) to confirm that four sampling points are sufficient to surrogate a space average above the canopy layer of the sparse roughness arrays. We propose a new morphological model from a systematic analysis of experimental data on the arrays. The friction velocity predicted by the proposed model agrees well with the peak value of the measured Reynolds shear stress. The proposed model is further validated in an additional wind-tunnel experiment conducted on a scaled configuration of a real urban area exposed to four wind directions. The proposed model is found to perform very well particularly in the estimation of the friction velocity, readily leading to a better estimation of turbulence, which is essential for an accurate prediction of pollutant dispersion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This study is related to the transport of inertial particles in a differentially heated cubic cavity. Three moderate values of the Rayleigh number Ra = 2×108, 4×108, 7×108 are considered. There is no back reaction from the particle on the flow, i.e., one-way coupling. Small (d = 15$\mu$m), intermediate (d = 35$\mu$m), and large (d = 75 $\mu$m) sizes of particles are used to study the particle behavior. The particles are influenced by two forces, the drag and gravity force. From our simulations, we observed that a large fraction of smallsized particles follow the flow motion and they are not significantly affected by gravity, remaining suspended in the flow. On the other hand, large-sized particles quickly settle down toward the bottom wall under gravity and are deposited at the bottom wall. Owing to this difference, particle distribution for small particles and large particles is quite different. Small particles tend to accumulate near a particular region near hot and cold walls, while the particle depletion region is observed in the core region in a particular pattern. Large particles are almost uniformly distributed. Detailed mechanisms are discussed using the flow field and particle response characteristics.},

abstract = {A new adaptive controller based on a neural network was constructed and applied to turbulent channel flow for drag reduction. A simple control network, which employs blowing and suction at the wall based only on the wall-shear stresses in the spanwise direction, was shown to reduce the skin friction by as much as 20% in direct numerical simulations of a low-Reynolds number turbulent channel flow. Also, a stable pattern was observed in the distribution of weights associated with the neural network. This allowed us to derive a simple control scheme that produced the same amount of drag reduction. This simple control scheme generates optimum wall blowing and suction proportional to a local sum of the wall-shear stress in the spanwise direction. The distribution of corresponding weights is simple and localized, thus making real implementation relatively easy. Turbulence characteristics and relevant practical issues are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institut of Physics.},

In particular, we investigate the effect of three formulations of the nonlinear convection term, which include the advective, skew-symmetric, and divergence forms, on the temporal accuracy and stability. Second-order temporal accuracy of the VDPM for both velocity and pressure is verified by establishing global error estimates in terms of a discrete-upl2-norm. Considering the energy evolution, we demonstrate that the VDPM is stable when the time step is less than or equal to a constant. Stability diagrams, which display the distributions of the maximum magnitude of the eigenvalues of the corresponding amplification matrices, are obtained using von Neumann analysis. These diagrams indicate that the advective form is more stable than the other formulations of the nonlinear convection term. Numerical tests are performed in order to support the mathematical findings involving temporal accuracy and stability, and the effects of the formulations of the nonlinear convection term are analyzed. Overall, our results indicate that the VDPM along with an advective discrete convection operator is almost unconditionally stable, second-order accurate in time, and computationally efficient because of the non-iterative solution procedure in solving the decoupled momentum equations.},

abstract = {We propose herein an efficient monolithic projection method (MPM) to solve time-dependent conjugate heat transfer problems involving not only natural convection in the fluid domain and heat conduction in the solid domain, but also the thermal interaction between solid and fluid domains across the solid–fluid interface. We obtain a global discretized linearized system by advancing the buoyancy, nonlinear convection, and linear diffusion terms in time using the Crank–Nicolson scheme and introducing the second-order central finite difference in space along with linearizing the nonlinear convection terms in both momentum and energy equations. The energy equations are simultaneously and implicitly discretized in both solid and fluid domains with the implemented Taylor series expansion for thermal interaction normal to the interface without an involved sub-time step iteration. Approximated lower–upper decompositions and an approximate factorization are also imposed to speed up the computation. Thus, we obtain a non-iterative monolithic projection method over the entire domain. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional (2D) conjugate natural convection and 2D conjugate Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection and periodic forced flows are performed to investigate the numerical performance of the proposed method. Consequently, the MPM correctly predicts the solution of the conjugate natural convection problem involving strong thermal interactions and provides a more stable and efficient computation than the semi-implicit projection method proposed by Kim and Moin (1985) [21] with a loosely or strongly coupled algorithm for the solid–fluid interface, while preserving the second-order temporal and spatial accuracy. Finally, the proposed method reasonably simulates a typical real-world problem, namely conjugate heat transfer through double-pane windows, by considering 2D heat conduction in each pane of glass for three different climatic conditions. Using the proposed MPM, we also investigate the effects of the air layer thickness ranging from 5 mm to 40 mm on the averaged Nusselt number and the distribution of temperature as well as fluid motion.},

These lift forces have been ignored in many previous studies on particle-laden turbulence. The trajectory of the particles can be changed by the lift forces, resulting in a significant modification of the stochastic characteristics of heavy particles. Probability density functions and autocorrelations are evaluated from the velocity of solid particle, acceleration of solid particles, and acceleration of fluid at the position of solid particle. Changes in velocity statistics are negligible but statistics related with acceleration are affected by the rotation of particle. When a laden particle encounters coherent structures during its motion, the particle's rotation might significantly affects the motion due to intermittently large fluid acceleration near the coherent structures.},

abstract = {We study implications of the assumption of power-law dependence of moments of energy dissipation in turbulence on the Reynolds number Re, holding due to intermittency. We demonstrate that at Re→∞ the dissipation's logarithm divided by lnRe converges with probability one to a negative constant. This implies that the dissipation is singular in the limit, as is known phenomenologically. The proof uses a large deviations function, whose existence is implied by the power-law assumption, and which provides the general asymptotic form of the dissipation's distribution. A similar function exists for vorticity and for velocity differences where it proves the moments representation of the multifractal model (MF). Then we observe that derivative of the scaling exponents of the dissipation, considered as a function of the order of the moment, is small at the origin. Thus the variation with the order is slow and can be described by a quadratic function. Indeed, the quadratic function, which corresponds to log-normal statistics, fits the data. Moreover, combining the lognormal scaling with the MF we derive a formula for the anomalous scaling exponents of turbulence which also fits the data. Thus lognormality, not to be confused with the Kolmogorov (1962) assumption of lognormal dissipation in the inertial range, when used in conjunction with the MF provides a concise way to get all scaling exponents of turbulence available at present.},

Two kinds of subgrid scale (SGS) models, the constant coefficient Smagorinsky model and the Vreman model, are assessed. Turbulent statistics, particularly turbulent stresses and wake patterns, are compared between the two SGS models for three different wind directions. We found that while the role of the SGS model is small on average, the local or instantaneous contribution to total stress near the surface or edge of the buildings is not negligible. By yielding a smaller eddy viscosity near solid surfaces, the Vreman model appears to be more appropriate for the simulation of a flow in a complex urban street canyon. Depending on wind direction, wind fields, turbulence statistics, and dispersion patterns show very different characteristics. Particularly, tall buildings near the street canyon predominantly generate turbulence, leading to homogenization of the mean flow inside the street canyon. Furthermore, the release position of pollutants sensitively determines subsequent dispersion characteristics.},

To investigate the performance of the Lagrangian model, we minimize model's dependence on empirical constants by selecting the simplest model for turbulent dissipation rate. The effect of viscosity is also included by adding a Brownian random walk calculate the position of a particle. For the no-slip condition at the wall and correct near-wall behavior of velocity, we develop a new boundary treatment for the particles that strike the wall. By applying the model to a fully developed turbulent channel flow at low Reynolds number, we investigate the model's performance through comparison with direct numerical simulation result.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional vortex dynamics have been studied in plasmas by exploiting the analogy between fluid velocity and the EXB drift velocity. The analogy extends to geophysical flows by including physics that mimic zonal flows, dissipation and the $\beta$-effect due to the variation in the Coriolis parameter. Vortices with the same sign as the ambient zonal shear are stable, while opposite-signed vortices fragment. Rules for vortex merger derived by maximizing entropy or minimizing enstrophy do not work for vortices embedded in zonal flows. New rules based on the minimization of energy hold. When zonal flows are not imposed, and the flow is forced at small scales, large, coherent jet streams or eddies form that co-exist with turbulence. Their sizes are determined by an energy balance, not the length scales of the forcing or boundaries. The motivation for this work is to understand atmospheric and ocean vortices: Gulf stream meanders and eddies, the Antarctic ozone hole, the jet streams of Earth and Jupiter, and the Jovian Great Red Spot and White Ovals. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We develop a theory of spatial distribution of fine bubbles in turbulence and confirm it numerically. The bubbles are a few hundred microns in size and the considered value of the turbulence's strength is typical for oceans. The fluid applies a lift force on bubbles that causes bubble clustering by acting in a direction perpendicular to the rise velocity and the horizontal vorticity. We demonstrate that the centripetal attraction of bubbles to the cores of vortices is negligible compared with this effect. The combined action of the lift and the turbulence creates a continuum flow of bubbles distinct from the flow of the fluid and identical to the Peddley-Kessler (PK) model of swimming phytoplankton cells in the limit of strong gravitaxis. This allows one to derive a whole array of results by applying the theory of this model, which is well developed in the limit. The similarity explains the patchiness and clustering of bubbles in regions of downwelling flow; these properties are understood for motile phytoplankton. The bubble clustering decreases the average rise velocity, prolonging the time until the bubble's rupture at the surface. We demonstrate that bubbles form columnar structures characterized by a multifractal distribution with the dimension deficit increasing as the eighth power of the radius. Fractal dimensions are derived from the information dimension given by the Kaplan-Yorke formula. We also provide some results for the shape-dependent PK model. We confirm the theory by direct numerical simulations of the bubbles' motion in Navier-Stokes turbulence.},

abstract = {To solve time-dependent natural convection problems, we propose a fully decoupled monolithic projection method. The proposed method applies the Crank–Nicolson scheme in time and the second-order central finite difference in space. To obtain a non-iterative monolithic method from the fully discretized nonlinear system, we first adopt linearizations of the nonlinear convection terms and the general buoyancy term with incurring second-order errors in time. Approximate block lower-upper decompositions, along with an approximate factorization technique, are additionally employed to a global linearly coupled system, which leads to several decoupled subsystems, i.e., a fully decoupled monolithic procedure. We establish global error estimates to verify the second-order temporal accuracy of the proposed method for velocity, pressure, and temperature in terms of a discrete l2-norm. Moreover, according to the energy evolution, the proposed method is proved to be stable if the time step is less than or equal to a constant. In addition, we provide numerical simulations of two-dimensional Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection and periodic forced flow. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the time step limitation, reduces the computational cost because only one Poisson equation is required to be solved, and preserves the second-order temporal accuracy for velocity, pressure, and temperature. Finally, the proposed method reasonably predicts a three-dimensional Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection for different Rayleigh numbers.},

In particular, we focus on Ag-water and Cu-water nanofluids, and investigate the effects of the nanoparticle volume fraction on the flow and heat transfer characteristics under the influence of thermal buoyancy and temperature dependent internal heat generation or absorption. The numerical results indicate that an increase in the nanoparticle volume fraction will decrease the velocity boundary layer thickness while increasing the thermal boundary layer thickness, even in the presence of free convection currents and internal heat generation. Meanwhile, the presence of nanoparticles results in an increase in the magnitude of the skin friction along the surface and a decrease in the magnitude of the local Nusselt number. Such effects are found to be more pronounced in the Ag-water solution than in the Cu-water solution; indeed, the Ag-water solution decreases the boundary layer thickness more than that of the Cu-water solution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Flows with various Reynolds numbers are investigated at fixed Grashof number, and flow pattern is examined through streamlines and iso-surfaces of helicity. Phase plots constructed by velocity components, Nusselt number and torque reveal the transition between different flow regimes. With Grashof number less than 3000, the flow go through a sequence of axisymmetric, spiral and Taylor-Couette flow as Reynolds number increases, while the flow with Grashof number 4000 shows complex pattern including quasi-periodic flows and chaos in a wide range of Reynolds number. Transition to chaos is investigated using the budget analysis of centrifugal and buoyant forces, indicating that competition between the two driving forces causes chaos.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of particle-laden homogeneous isotropic turbulence are performed to investigate interparticle collisions in a wide range of Stokes numbers. Dynamics of the particles are described by Stokes drag including particle-particle interactions via hard-sphere collisions, while fluid turbulence is solved using a pseudospectral method. Particular emphasis is placed on interparticle-collision-based conditional statistics of rotation and dissipation rates of the fluid experienced by heavy particles, which provide essential information on the collision process. We also investigate the collision statistics of collision time interval and angle. Based on a Lamb vortex model for a vortex structure, we claim that collision events occur in the edge region for vortical structures in the intermediate-Stokes-number regime, suggesting that the sling effect enhances collision as well as clustering.},

abstract = {We propose an immersed boundary (IB) formulation incorporating a two-layer wall model approach for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations with complex geometry. The main objective of the present study is to broaden the capability of the IB method to high-Reynolds number turbulent flows with non-equilibrium effects. A two-layer wall model is applied to the IB method by considering a thin boundary layer approximation near the wall in order to reduce the computational cost of resolving the turbulent boundary layer. Tangential pressure gradient and convective terms are included in the thin boundary layer equation to make the wall model suitable for non-equilibrium flows, in which cross-derivative terms are modeled along the wall-normal direction to maintain the ordinary differential form of the equation. Turbulent viscosity in the inner layer is determined using a simplified k−ϵ−f$\mu$ model, that performs better than the typical mixing-length model in the separation and reattachment regions, where the friction velocity u$\tau$ becomes zero. To impose the mass conservation constraint near the IB surface with marginal computational cost, the IB approximated domain method is applied. The proposed IB formulation is validated using numerical simulations of two-dimensional turbulent channel flow, backward-facing step flow, turbulent flow around a circular cylinder, and three-dimensional turbulent flow over a wall-mounted circular sphere with a relatively coarse grid near the IB surface. The results demonstrate that the proposed IB formulation captures the flow patterns well and accurately predicts wall shear stress for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium flows, even with a relatively coarse grid near the wall.},

abstract = {The dynamics of air bubbles in turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard (RB) convection is described for the first time using laboratory experiments and complementary numerical simulations. We performed experiments at and, where streams of 1 mm bubbles were released at various locations from the bottom of the tank along the path of the roll structure. Using three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry, we simultaneously tracked a large number of bubbles to inspect the pair dispersion, for a range of initial separations, spanning one order of magnitude, namely; here is the local Kolmogorov length scale. Pair dispersion, of the bubbles within a quiescent medium was also determined to assess the effect of inhomogeneity and anisotropy induced by the RB convection. Results show that underwent a transition phase similar to the ballistic-to-diffusive (-to-) regime in the vicinity of the cell centre; it approached a bulk behavior in the diffusive regime as the distance away from the cell centre increased. At small, is shown in the diffusive regime with a lower magnitude compared to the quiescent case, indicating that the convective turbulence reduced the amplitude of the bubble's fluctuations. This phenomenon associated to the bubble path instability was further explored by the autocorrelation of the bubble's horizontal velocity. At large initial separations, was observed, showing the effect of the roll structure.},

abstract = {The objective of the current paper is to clarify the physical distinction between turbulence modulations by laden particles in decaying isotropic turbulence and stationary isotropic turbulence. Direct numerical simulations of stationary and decaying isotropic turbulence were carried out using 1283 grid points at a Taylor micro-scale Reynolds number of R$\lambda$ $\sim$ 70. The effect of O(106) solid particles with a different Stokes number (St) was implemented as a point-force approximation in the Navier-Stokes equation. Turbulent kinetic energy, acceleration, enstrophy, strain rate, and various spectra were examined to determine the distinctions. Turbulence modulation in decaying turbulence is qualitatively and quantitatively inconsistent compared to that in stationary turbulence, particularly when the particles have St ≤ 1, mainly due to the artificial forcing necessary for stationary status. For the particles with St > 1, however, decaying and stationary turbulence are qualitatively similar. A simple analysis confirms that stationary turbulence is not appropriate for the study of turbulence modulation by particles with St ≤ 1. Furthermore, the injection perturbation of particles has a significant effect on turbulence modulation in decaying turbulence. An investigation of the correlation between turbulence field zones and the two-way interaction energy was conducted to gain a better understanding of the modulation mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A realistic inflow boundary condition is essential for successful simulation of the developing turbulent boundary layer or channel flows. In the present work, we applied generative adversarial networks (GANs), a representative of unsupervised learning, to generate an inlet boundary condition of turbulent channel flow. Upon learning the two-dimensional spatial structure of turbulence using data obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel flow, the GAN could generate instantaneous flow fields that are statistically similar to those of DNS. After learning data at only three Reynolds numbers, the GAN could produce fields at various Reynolds numbers within a certain range without additional simulation. Eventually, through a combination of the GAN and a recurrent neural network (RNN), we developed a novel model (RNN-GAN) that could generate time-varying fully developed flow for a long time. The spatiotemporal correlations of the generated flow are in good agreement with those of the DNS. This proves the usefulness of unsupervised learning in the generation of synthetic turbulence fields.},

abstract = {During the Joule-heating induced crystallization (JIC) process of amorphous silicon for display applications, its phase transformation from amorphous to polycrystalline phases occurs through two different kinetic paths of either solid-to-solid or solid-to-liquid-to-solid phases. Depending on input conditions such as power density and pulsing time, each path results in nano-crystalline silicon phases or large grain structures produced by lateral growth, respectively. In this study, the phase-transformation phenomena during the JIC process were detected electrically and optically by the in-situ measurements of input voltage/current and normal reflectance at wavelength of 532 nm. The temperature field estimated from a simple conduction model confirms the phase-transformation behavior observed experimentally. In addition we could obtain the poly-Si structure produced by solid phase crystallization having the process time of 250 $\mu$s and reaching the highest temperature around 1350 K. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.
