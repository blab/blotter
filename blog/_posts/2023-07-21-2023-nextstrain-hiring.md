Positions for a [bioinformatics analyst](#bioinformatics-analyst-iiiii) and a [software engineer](#software-engineer-ii) are available immediately in the Bedford lab at the Fred Hutch. Details for both positions follow:

-----------------------------------------

### Bioinformatics Analyst II/III

We have an opening for a bioinformatician in the [Bedford lab](https://bedford.io/) at the Fred Hutch to work on genomic epidemiology and evolutionary analysis of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, seasonal influenza, and [other emerging and endemic pathogens](https://nextstrain.org/pathogens). This position will contribute to ongoing work for the Bedford lab and Nextstrain.

[Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) is an award-winning project for tracking infectious disease epidemics developed in collaboration with the [Neher lab](https://neherlab.org/) at the University of Basel. Nextstrain won the [Open Science Prize](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/open-science-prize-announces-epidemic-tracking-tool-grand-prize-winner) in Feb 2017 and has been instrumental in analysis of the [SARS-CoV-2 pandemic](https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2), [Ebola outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/inrb-drc/ebola-nord-kivu), [Zika spread](https://nextstrain.org/zika/) in the Americas and is used by the World Health Organization to aid in the process of [influenza vaccine strain selection](https://nextstrain.org/flu/). The software we write to power [all parts](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/learn/parts.html) of Nextstrain---bioinformatics, visualizations, analysis pipelines, data management, and more---is entirely [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) and [available to the public](https://github.com/nextstrain). We work with public health entities and scientists across the world, both formally and informally, to expand pathogen surveillance capabilities and to improve the automation and robustness of these analyses. Our goal is to empower the wider genomic epidemiology and public health communities to tweak our analyses, create new ones, and communicate scientific insights using the same tools we do.

#### Responsibilities

This role advances the research aims of the Bedford lab and the Nextstrain team through a combination of independent work, collaboration with scientists and software developers in the group, and interactions with the wider public health and science communities. In this role, the bioinformatician will:

-   Develop and maintain analytic pipelines such as those that clean and ingest genome metadata, build phylogenetic trees, and run forecasting models for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens
-   Improve the robustness, automation, and monitoring of our existing pathogen pipelines
-   Develop reproducible pipelines to expand surveillance of endemic and emerging human pathogens, in collaboration with both internal and external groups
-   Participate in community outreach through office hours, discussion forums, and mailing lists
-   Write and maintain thorough documentation on software and pipelines
-   Design software with a diverse range of collaborators and users in mind
-   Contribute to the Nextstrain team's decision-making and planning processes
-   Present at Bedford lab meetings

#### Qualifications

##### Minimum qualifications

-   Master's degree in bioinformatics, computational biology, biology, or related field with at least three years' direct experience in computational analysis of large sequence-based molecular data sets.
-   Fluency in at least one high-level programming language, such as Python, R, Ruby, JavaScript, or Perl
-   Familiarity with version control and other software development best practices
-   Experience with workflow managers such as Snakemake, Nextflow, or WDL
-   Knowledge of molecular biology
-   Motivated to learn new skills and technologies and collaborate within an existing team's practices
-   Excellent written and verbal communication skills

##### Preferred qualifications

-   Expertise in genomics
-   Knowledge of automated testing and workflows such as GitHub Actions
-   Experience configuring and deploying analyses on a cloud infrastructure

To aid in applicant review, a coding sample is requested. We're happy to review whatever you're most proud of (in any programming language). If you don't have code that can be publicly shared, that's okay. Please apply anyway and just let us know that this isn't available.

If you think you might be a great fit for this position but are concerned about meeting all qualifications, we'd like to hear from you. Please email Trevor Bedford at tb<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@bedford.io and John Huddleston jhuddles<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@fredhutch.org.

### Software Engineer II

> After receiving a high volume of interest, we have stopped taking new applications to focus on the existing ones. If needed, we will re-open the job listing for new applications.

The [Bedford Lab](https://bedford.io/) at the [Fred Hutch](https://fredhutch.org/) is seeking a software engineer to work on [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/), an [award-winning](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/open-science-prize-announces-epidemic-tracking-tool-grand-prize-winner) project for tracking infectious disease epidemics such as the [SARS-CoV-2 pandemic](https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2), [Ebola outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/inrb-drc/ebola-nord-kivu), [Zika spread](https://nextstrain.org/zika/) in the Americas, [seasonal flu](https://nextstrain.org/flu/), and [other emerging and endemic pathogens](https://nextstrain.org/pathogens). This position will augment our existing team to design, develop, maintain, operate, and support our software and services that empower research scientists and public health practitioners in the lab and around the world.

Nextstrain, developed in collaboration with the [Neher Lab](https://neherlab.org/) at the University of Basel, provides tools for evolutionary analysis of pathogens and genomic epidemiology. We write [open source software](https://github.com/nextstrain/) in a public development style to power [all parts](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/learn/parts.html) of Nextstrain---bioinformatics, visualizations, analysis pipelines, data management, and more---and our analyses use open data whenever possible. We work with public health entities and scientists across the world, both formally and informally, to expand pathogen surveillance capabilities and to improve the automation and robustness of these analyses.
