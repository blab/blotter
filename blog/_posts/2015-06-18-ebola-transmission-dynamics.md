In collaboration with a large consortium from Harvard, the Broad Institute, the University of Edinburgh, Tulane University, the CDC, Kenema Government Hospital and others, we've just published a paper in [Cell](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.007) detailing the [transmission dynamics of Ebola virus circulating in Sierra Leone between May and December last year](/papers/park-ebola-transmission/). Here, we present 232 new Ebola genome sequences and combine these sequences with 86 previously characterized genomes to give a broad picture of the evolution of the virus during the Sierra Leone epidemic. We find evidence for a sustained epidemic within Sierra Leone driven by endemic transmission rather than by repeated introductions from Guinea or Liberia. We also investigate evidence for evolutionary adaptation to the human host, finding that genome-wide selection is largely purifying, aiming to maintain the Ebola genome in a fixed state rather than selecting for new mutations. However, we do see some signal from the glycoprotein gene for faster rates of evolution in regions that are putative antibody epitopes. We attribute this signal to within-host selection for immune escape during the course of an infection.

This was a fantastic collaboration to a be a part of. I'm glad I got to play a small role in such a timely analysis.
