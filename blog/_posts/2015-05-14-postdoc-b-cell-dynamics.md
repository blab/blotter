I'm looking for a postdoc to work on computational immunology.  The advertisement follows:

> A new postdoctoral position is available in the groups of [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/) and [Erick Matsen](http://matsen.fredhutch.org/) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center located in Seattle, WA. This position will focus on analyzing immune repertoire sequence data from an evolutionary perspective. 

> Deep sequencing of B cell repertoires has opened up the possibility of understanding the immune response at a molecular level. This project will analyze repertoire data to compare processes of clonal expansion and affinity maturation in primary and secondary immune responses. These studies will allow, for the first time, a detailed mechanistic understanding of original antigenic sin in viral infection; results from these studies may allow construction of vaccines that better deal with a diversity of pathogen exposures. This work represents a collaboration with experimental colleagues at the Fred Hutch, Emory University and Adaptive Biotechnologies. There will be no want of fresh data.

> The ideal candidate will have experience with working with sequence data and a strong interest in model-based statistical analysis of real data sets. Data sets will comprise millions of B cell repertoire sequences and so strong coding abilities are essential. Candidates should have experience in at least one programming language and a proven track-record of peer reviewed publications. Candidates with PhDs from diverse backgrounds are encouraged to apply, including biology, mathematics, statistics, physics and computer science. However, experience in phylogenetics or immunological bioinformatics is especially opportune. The Fred Hutch is an equal opportunity employer, committed to workforce diversity. Women and minorities are particularly encouraged to apply.

> The position is available immediately with flexible starting dates for a 2-year appointment with possibility of extension.  Informal inquires are welcome.  Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.  The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center offers competitive salaries commensurate with experience and skills, complete with benefits.

> To apply please send (1) cover letter that includes the names and contacts for three references and a short statement of research interests, (2) a current CV and (3) code samples or links to published/distributed code to trevor<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@bedford.io.
