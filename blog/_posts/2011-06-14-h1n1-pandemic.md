It's a reassuring thing when science works the way it's supposed to and the pieces mesh together.  A paper by McLeish and colleagues just came out looking at [sero-prevalence of pandemic H1N1 from 2009 to winter 2010 in Scotland](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020358).  This comes from measuring antibodies specific to pandemic H1N1 in a large sample of the population.  McLeish et al. find that through March 2010, approximately 35% of people in Scotland were infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza.  This number apparently came as a surprise to the media and the story has been getting a lot of play.

However, what's cool is that this 35% number is exactly what we expected from our epidemiological models.  The basic reproductive number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> measures the number of secondary infections expected to result from a given infection in a naive host population (a population with no previous exposure).  This number was quite small for the H1N1 pandemic, estimated [at around 1.2 to 1.3 from the early upswing of the pandemic in 2009](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5934/1557.abstract).  The original paper detailing the SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) gives the formula: `\( Z = 1 - e^{-R_0 Z} \)`, where <i>Z</i> represents the final size of an epidemic (in terms of proportion of the population infected).  Numerically solving this for these values of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> gives an expected final epidemic size of 31% to 42%.  This is amazingly on target.
