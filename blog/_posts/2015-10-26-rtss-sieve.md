In collaboration with [Dan Neafsey](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/daniel-neafsey) at the Broad Institute, [Dyann Wirth](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/dyann-wirth/) at Harvard, [Peter Gilbert](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/gilbert-peter.html) and [Michal Juraska](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/juraska-michal.html) at the Fred Hutch and a large team of researchers, we've just published [a paper](/papers/neafsey-rtss-sieve/) in the [New England Journal of Medicine](http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1505819) showing strain-specific vaccine efficacy in a recent vaccine trial. We found that the [RTS,S malaria vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTS,S) worked better against strains that were genetically matched to the vaccine antigen compared to unmatched strains. There was a 1-year vaccine efficacy of 50% against strains perfectly matched to the vaccine antigen and a 1-year vaccine efficacy of 33% against unmatched strains. The vaccine contained antigen from the reference strain 3D7, which is at low (~10%) frequency in Sub-Saharan Africa. This suggests that vaccine efficacy could be straight-forwardly improved by just swapping the vaccine strain for a more common haplotype.

It's interesting to see strain-specific vaccine for malaria, suggesting that like flu, a good vaccine requires matching to the circulating pathogen strains. This was a fun study to participate in. Hopefully, we could see further improvements to the RTS,S vaccine. Even at current efficacy levels, RTS,S is estimated to have a cost effectiveness of [~$150 per disability-adjusted life year](http://www.malariajournal.com/content/13/1/66) saved.
